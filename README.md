For a final project in AMST : Local Commuter Rail History, I analyzed the relationship between the construction of commuter rail stations and both property values and population. I found that there was not a noticable effect on either of these factors for the six lines studied. 
Data sources:
Most rail alignment from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics

Most station locations from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics

Population data and census tract locations from the US Census Bureau Decennial Survey (accessed via tidycensus)
Housing price data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency
